# College Scorecard Analysis

This repository contains the following files related to data collection from the College Scorecard government API using Python's `requests` package:

* `CollegeScorecard-CollectClean.ipynb`, containing full code to read in the apikey, create a dictionary of desired fields to pull from the api, the requests api call, and page by page for loop to create df
* The full resulting dataset: `college_df.csv`

More details can be found in my blog post: [College Scorecard](https://runstats21.github.io/stat-386-projects/2022/10/17/webscraping-post.html)
