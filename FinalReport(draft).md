# Final Report: College ROI Analysis

## Introduction

## EDA

## ML models explored

### Model Selection

CATBoost was considered, as I have heard it is a very effective method, but then I realized it is mean't to deal with "CAT"egorical features well, which would lend itself better for a classification focused analysis.

### Best Model

Hyperparameter tuning end up showing that many of the defaults in a Random Forest model are the optimal decision.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Future work can be done to complete in-depth cluster analysis of the 4-year degree awarding colleges in my dataset, to examine if this grouping of similar colleges can provide more information into expected income of alumni, and therefore improve model fit (R-squared) and predictive performance (RMSE).
